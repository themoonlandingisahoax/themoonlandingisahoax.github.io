										<p>The Moon landing conspiracy theories are conspiracy theories which claim that some or all elements of
										the Apollo program and the associated Moon landings were hoaxes staged by NASA with the aid of other organizations.</p>

										<h3>Space Race</h3>
										<p>During the time of the Apollo missions, the United States and the Soviet Union had been engaged in a Cold War.  Successfully faking a moon landing would generate international acclaim and give the US a leg up in the Space Race and the Cold War.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>NASA and Kennedy</h3>
										<p>Believers of this theory assert that NASA faked the moon landings to avoid humiliation and to continue to get funding.  Since many conspiracists believed that it was impossible to send humans to the moon, they asserted that the landings were faked to fulfill President Kennedy's legacy.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-diamond"></span>
										<h3>Vietnam War</h3>
										<p>Since the Apollo Mission was suddenly downgraded at the same time the Vietnam War had ended, many believe that the landings were faked to distract the American public from the war.  This is one of the least popular theories, since it has the least substantial "evidence".</p>

									<h2>Hoax and Rebuttals</h2>
									<p>The flag's movement, they say, clearly shows the presence of wind, which is 
										impossible in a vacuum. NASA says Aldrin was twisting the flagpole to get 
										the moon soil, which caused the flag to move. The chance of a successful 
										manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite 
										close monitoring by the USSR, it would have been easier for NASA to fake 
										the Moon landings than to really go there.</p>

								<p class="content">The flag was moving due to the astronaut manipulating when he was placing it 
									into the moon’s surface. The Apollo 15 crew left a retroreflector on the moon’s surface, 
									when scientists “shoot” a laser toward the designated moon surface it reflects allowing us 
									to confirm that the crew actually visited the moon.</p>

									<h2>Flat Earth Theory</h2>
									<p>Many began to question the validity of the government late in the 20th century, 
										however, this wasn’t the first occurrence. Throughout American history individuals have 
										questioned if information was altered or manipulated. For example, during WW1 many
										questioned how the war was actually playing out since all information passed through Britain 
										before it reached American pupils. In this manner people began to question the long held 
										understanding that the Earth was theorized as being a globe. Initially, this view was held as 
										blasphemy, however, it soon gained a large following across the Earth.</p>
