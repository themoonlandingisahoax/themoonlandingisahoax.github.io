								<h2>The "Moon Landing"</h2>
								<p>There government’s secrecy throughout American history has led to many to claim faults or 
									supposed evidence for propaganda used throughout the years. They usually arise from 
									individuals who call themselves the “truth-seekers”. </p>
								<p>The Moon Landing, “was too perfect”, claim many, who see the chances of actually landing on our moon as doubtful. 
									Many have insisted that that the moon landing was staged, even getting expert opinions that describe the presence 
									of a spotlight. Theories on why it was staged range, from as simple as promoting nationalism to scaring a 
									superpower with advancing technology. In hindsight, all these theories are diverging from a single point, which 
									being doubt; it clearly asserts that some have always questioned the government, and some have been too accepting.</p>
								<h2>The Flat Earth Theory</h2>
								<p>The beginning of the Flat Earth Theory focused on aspects that surrounded orthodox views concerning 
									the spherical shape of the Earth. These claims transferred over to the government as early as the 
									1920s. They began to claim very obscure cases, such as disapproving the ship disappearing over the 
									horizon evidence.</p>
								<p>Today they have retained vast lengths of evidence, and also have developed their non-heliocentric theory of 
									Earth’s position in space. The FET has claimed that gravity doesn’t exist, however, propose that the Earth 
									is travelling a constant 9.8m/s “up” in space. The theory also consists of a “flat Earth” model where the 
									Earth has 2 individual bodies circulating, which are the Sun and Moon. In addition, claims that have targeted 
									the government including NASA’s ever changing pictures of the Earth “from space”, to the UN’s use of a flat 
									Earth on their flag. The amount of evidence and claims proposed by FET is endless ranging from the non-heliocentric 
									model to the oldest law of physics. Where did this all rise from, religious texts that indicate a firmament and 
									a totally different world.</p>
